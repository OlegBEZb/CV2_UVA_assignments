We have to accept the sad fact that mostly the code for the assignment doesn't work. [icp](src/icp.py) algorithm doesn't 
converge properly. [The icp algorithm based on tutorial](src/not_used_attempts/icp_based_on_tutorial.py) worked pretty well
but we didn't continue with it as we were not sure about the convergence and the code was not ours. 

Quick notes
1. Don't forget to initialize the ```DATA_DIR``` variable with the data folder
2. [icp.py](src/icp.py) was used to produce results 
3. [Evaluation.ipynb](src/Evaluation.ipynb) was used to address the evaluation part of the report
4. [person_reconstruction.py](src/person_reconstruction.py) was used for pose estimation
