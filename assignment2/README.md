# Structure from Motion assignment

This assignment is performed by UvA students Angela van Sprang, Oleg Litvinov, Emily Mes in 2021.

# Requirements

Before launching the code, install the requirements. In the assignment folder run the following in terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data

The house dataset have to be unpacked and stored in Data/House folder.

# Reproducing the results

The sources may be found in the [src](src/) folder. To reproduce the results, open
the [detailed_experiments notebook](src/detailed_experiments.ipynb)
and run all cells. NB: the notebook contains 3d point visualisations which are printed externally in a separate window 
and therefore have to be closed explicitly to let the notebook run further.
